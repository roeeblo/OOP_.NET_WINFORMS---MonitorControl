## Personal Note
My old monitor had a built-in option for a timer. After changing to a new monitor which doesnt have that feature (because the old one broke down), i came up with the idea to make this app. Hope anyone who struggled like me will find it simple and helpful.


## Features 
- Set timer in **seconds or minutes**
- Visual countdown display
- Cancel anytime
- Lightweight (no installation needed)

## How to Use 
1. **Download** and **run** the  `MonitorControl.exe`
2. **Set** your desired time (ex: "30 minutes")
3. **Click Start** - your monitor will turn off when time elapses
