# Monitor Shutdown Timer ðŸ•’âš¡

A simple WinForms application that turns off your monitor after a specified time.

## Personal Note
My old monitor had a built-in option for a timer. After changing my monitor, because the old one broke down, i had to come up with an idea, so i decided to make this app. Hope anyone who struggled like me will find it simple and helpful.
